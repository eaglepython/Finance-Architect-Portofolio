## 🚀 **Files Moved and Organized**

### ✅ **Completed Projects** (with working code):
1. **Multi-Armed Bandit Portfolio** → `01-machine-learning-finance/multi-armed-bandit-portfolio/`
2. **LSTM HFT Predictor** → `02-deep-learning-finance/lstm-hft-predictor/`
3. **Transformer Credit Risk** → `02-deep-learning-finance/transformer-credit-risk/`
4. **Quantum Portfolio Optimization** → `03-quantum-machine-learning/quantum-portfolio-optimization/`

### 📝 **Documentation Organized**:
- `readme1.md` → `04-documentation/portfolio_overview.md`
- `readme2.md` → `04-documentation/complete_portfolio_details.md`

## 📊 **Performance Highlights Now Clearly Displayed**

| Category | Best Project | Key Metric | Value |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **ML Finance** | Multi-Armed Bandit | Annual Return | **15.3%** |
| **Deep Learning** | LSTM HFT Predictor | Annual Return | **23.7%** |
| **Quantum ML** | Portfolio Optimization | Speedup | **72x** |
